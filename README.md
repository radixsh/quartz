# Quartz
Quartz is a Discord bot whose capabilities don't fall into any specific category. Ask them `>h`, or read the source code, for more specific information. Notable functionalities currently include connections to some public APIs (`joke`, `cat`, `dog`, and `bitcoin` return jokes, animal pictures, and Bitcoin conversion rates respectively).

I hope to be able to implement emoji uploading soon.
