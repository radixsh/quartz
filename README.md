# Bitz? Quartz?
Qubitz is an uwubot and a music bot that can upload custom emojis and help you
find people by their roles.

I began developing an uwubot named Bitz for Discord in June 2020, in discord.js
because the first guides I found were in JavaScript. This turned out to be very
misguided, because (as I realized when our AP Computer Science Principles
teacher taught us Python and the basics of discord.py later that year)
discord.py is far superior. Over the summer of 2020, I developed and hosted both
bots on my Chromebook. Sometime or other I also spun up another discord.py bot,
Amicitia, to help students in a university Discord server find people with the
same major (majors being defined in roles).

I've wanted to translate Bitz's uwubot functionalities to Python for a while,
and I finally did, almost two years later. Bitz, the original uwubot I created,
has been translated to Python and conflated with Quartz's capabilities to form
Qubitz.

## Functionalities
Qubitz's functionalities include:
- `ping`: Pokes Qubitz to see if they're awake.
- `uptime`: Displays how long Qubitz has been awake.
- `create_emoji [name]`: Sets attached image as a custom server emoji with the
  given name.
- `info`: Gets guild and user information.
- `uwuify [any message here]`: Uwuifies your message, deleting the comand
  message.
- `echo [any message here]`: Echoes back your message, deleting the command
  message.
- `cat`: Shows a cat from [The Cat API](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search).
- `list`: Lists each role and everyone in them.
- `find [any role here]`: Prints a list of everyone with the given role.
- `play [any YouTube search term here]`: Searches YouTube and streams the audio
  of the first result in vc.
- `now_playing`: Displays the currently playing song.
- `queue`: Displays the song queue.
- `remove`: Removes a song from the queue.
- `skip`: Skips the currently playing song.
- `stop`: Disconnects Qubitz from vc and clears the song queue.

## Technologies
- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [discord.ext.commands](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/index.html)
- [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)

## Usage
To set Qubitz up locally, you'll need `python3` and the packages for `discord`,
`requests`, and `aiohttp`.

You'll also need an API token, which you get by creating an application in your
Discord [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Click
the subheading "bot" in the menubar on the left and add a bot, and a secret
token will have been generated under the bot's username.

Create a file called `env.py` with this as its contents:
```sh
TOKEN = "your-token-here-between-quotes"
```

In the developer portal again, under Bot, enable the server members and message
content intents. Under OAuth2 > URL Generator, generate an
[invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=812437788535423008&permissions=3468352&scope=bot)
by selecting the "bot" scope and adding the following permissions:
- Read Messages / View Channels
- Send Mesages
- Manage Messages
- Embed Links
- Attach Files
- Use External Emojis
- Add Reactions

Then you can run Qubitz with `python3 index.py` (or `nodemon --exec python3
index.py`).

    the config file responds to calls from the index file.
