# Bitz? Quartz?
I began developing an uwubot named Bitz for Discord in June 2020, in discord.js
because the first guides I found were in JavaScript. This turned out to be very
misguided, because (as I realized when our AP Computer Science Principles
teacher taught us the basics of discord.py later that year) discord.py is far
superior. Over the summer of 2020, I developed and hosted both bots on my
Chromebook.

I've wanted to translate Bitz's uwubot functionalities to Python for a while,
and I finally did, almost two years later. Bitz, the original uwubot I created,
has been translated to Python and conflated with Quartz's capabilities to form
Qubitz.

## Functionalities
Qubitz's functionalities include:
- `create_emoji [name]`: Create custom emojis by running this command and
  attaching an image file. If Qubitz has the necessary permissions, the image
  will be uploaded as a custom emoji in that guild.
- `info`: Get data about users in the guild.
- `echo [any message here]`: Anyone can `echo` anything, which is a good feature
  for pseudo-anonymity and general shenanigans.
- `uwuify [any message here]`: Uwuifies your messages, turning "hello" into
  "hewwo" and so on.
- `cat`: Get a cat picture using [The Cat API](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search).
- `list`: List each role, along with the users with that role. This
  functionality was ported from Amicitia, a bot intended to help students in my
  university Discord server find people with the same major. Amicitia's
  dedicated repo is now dead and gone in favor of Qubitz.
- `find [any role here]`: Print a list of everyone with a given role. This
  functionality was ported from Amicitia.

## Technologies
- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [discord.ext.commands](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/index.html)
- [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
    - [`nodemon --exec python3 hello.py`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65021005/how-to-run-python-3-with-nodemon)
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)

## Usage
To set Qubitz up locally, you'll need `python3` and the packages for `discord`,
`requests`, and `aiohttp`.

You'll also need an API token, which you do by going to your Discord 
[developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and creating an
application. Click the subheading "bot" in the menubar on the left and add a
bot, and a secret token will have been generated under the bot's username.

Create a file called `env.py` with this as its contents:
```sh
TOKEN = "your-token-here-between-quotes"
```

In the developer portal again, under Bot, enable the server members and message
content intents. Under OAuth2 > URL Generator, generate an 
[invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=812437788535423008&permissions=3468352&scope=bot)
by selecting the "bot" scope and adding the following permissions:
- Read Messages/View Channels
- Send Mesages
- Manage Messages
- Embed Links
- Attach Files
- Use External Emojis
- Add Reactions

Then you can run Qubitz:
```
$ python3 index.py

# Or, if you're a cool kid and you have nodemon:
$ nodemon --exec python3 index.py
```
