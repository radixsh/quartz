# bitz â€” discord bot
bitz is a simple discord bot written with node.js using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). bitz can delete messages, echo messages, create polls, and perform pings; bitz also responds rather interestingly to certain "owo", "uwu", and keysmash messages :)

## general info
i created bitz for three reasons: 
* to learn a bit of javascript to complement my basic understanding of html and css, 
* to apply what i learned in class studying java this past year, and 
* to have fun creating a bot for friends in the summer. 

in retrospect i could've chosen to learn python and use that to write bitz, but to be honest it was hard enough figuring out the discord api already, as well as fun enough learning where exactly my java knowledge ends and the discord.js documentation (and stack overflow wisdom) begins.
